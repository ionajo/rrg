### Summary information 

The Red River Gorge is located in the Daniel Boone National Forest and Menifee, Wolfe, and Powell Counties in eastern Kentucky. Visitors commonly refer to the area as "The Gorge" and is famous for its stunning cliffs and geological formations. 

Grays Arch is a sandstone arch in the <a href="/indexl.html">Red River Gorge</a> geological area in Kentucky. The arch is approximately 81-feet high, 100-feet long, and 24-feet wide. The arch formed under a thin ridge from differential weathering and headward erosion of surrounding streams. Neighboring waterfalls and rock house shelters tower over 100 feet in height.

The area is accessible by a well-maintained foot trail that is roughly 1.4 miles from a parking lot trailhead. The hike descends nearly 200 vertical feet with three flights of wooden stairs. Photographers rarely miss the inspiring view here of massive boulders and overhanging cliffs.
